MacOS Catalina: Cannot use the MongoDB Community version 5.0
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew install mongodb-community@4.4

extra installs:
$ pip install pymongo==3.11.2
$ pip install mongoengine==0.22.1

Brief Introduction:
The current versions of the functions are written in separate files.
They can be aggregated into one file after all are tested. (see database.py)

Notice:
Please use string formatted datetime in all the arguments
For all inquiries related to appliance, need to specify the database name

Issues:
Need to update the functions for dictionaries to allow direct addition to the dictionary (fixed)

-------------- Database entries --------------
id: a unique id for identifying the user
name: the name of the user specified during registration
family_size: how many people are there in the family?
readings: power meter readings with a time_id as the key for research
datetime: the time and date the corresponding power meter reading with the same time_id is recorded (format: %b-%d-%Y %H:%M:%S)
appliance:
    - In user_info (input):
        format: [[appliance, wattage, quantity, usage frequency],...] -> [[string, int/float, int, string],...]
        usage frequency choices: "all day", "often", "rare", "not in use"
    - Actually stored:
        The name of the collection
password:
    Should have at least one number.
    Should have at least one uppercase and one lowercase character.
    Should have at least one special symbol (@$!%*#?&).
    Should be between 5 to 15 characters long.
reset_Q: question to be asked per password reset
reset_A: answer to the question^
last_login_date: last date and time the user logged in

*** to do ***

-------------- db_login.py --------------
def connect_host(db_name, tab_name)
- Create a database and a table with specified names.

def add_db(client, db_name) # setup a new database with db_name
- Add a new database in the given client host connection

def add_table(db, tab_name)
- Add a new table to the given database with specified names.

def init_appliance(collection, app_info)
- Initialize all the appliance information in the database

def add_user(db, collection, user_info)
- Add a new entry to the database, usually a new user.
- Should check if the ids are replicated

def remove_collection(collection)
- Remove the whole table from database

def remove_user(db, collection, usr_id)
- Remove a specific user with his/her id.

def check_pwd(collection, usr_id, pwd)
- Check if the given password matches the one set in database

def get_new_id(collection)
- Assign a new id to the latest user.
- to do: (could be reusable ids for future considerations)

def get_id_by_name(collection, name)
- Get the id of the user with specified name

def get_reset_question(collection, usr_id)
- Get the reset password question

def reset_pwd(collection, usr_id, ans, new_pwd)
- Check the answer to the reset question
- Reset the password in the database

def check_pwd_validity(passwd)
- Check if the input password meets the requirement:
    - Should have at least one number.
    - Should have at least one uppercase and one lowercase character.
    - Should have at least one special symbol (@$!%*#?&).
    - Should be between 5 to 15 characters long.

*** to do ***

-------------- db_update.py --------------
def add_power_reading(collection, usr_id, readings, dates, time)
- Add new power meter readings to the present database

def update_family_info(collection, usr_id, family)
- Update the number of family members

def update_appliance_info(db, collection, usr_id, updated_info)
- Update the household appliance information
- Need to specify all the appliance information in the database (as we will delete all the former information)
- updated_info format: [[appliance, wattage, quantity, usage frequency],...] -> [[string, int/float, int, string],...]

def update_password(collection, usr_id, pwd)
- Update a password

def update_last_login(collection, usr_id)
- Update the last log in time of the user

*** to do ***
def check_reading()

-------------- db_search.py --------------
def print_collection(collection)
def print_user_info(db, collection, usr_id)
def print_appliance_info(db, collection, usr_id)

def search_appliance_list(db, collection, usr_id)
- Get all appliance infomation in an array
- return format: [[appliance, wattage, quantity, usage frequency],...] -> [[string, int/float, int, string],...]

def search_power_reading_all(collection, usr_id, return_string = True)
- return all power meter readings
- return power_readings, dates in corresponding chronological orders
- can choose either as a string or a datetime return format

def search_power_reading_date(collection, usr_id, min_date, max_date, return_string = True)
- return the power meter readings during the given time interval
- return power_readings, dates in corresponding chronological orders
- can choose either as a string or a datetime return format

def search_last_update(collection, usr_id, return_string = True)
- return the latest update datetime of the readings
- can choose either as a string or a datetime return format

*** to do ***

-------------- analysis.py --------------
def plot_temporal(collection, usr_id, min_date, max_date)
- plot the power meter readings during the given time interval

def plot_temporal_incremental(collection, usr_id, min_date, max_date)
- plot the power meter reading increments during the given time interval

--------------bill.py --------------
def estimate_bill_month(collection, usr_id, month = None)
def estimate_bill_period(collection, usr_id, min_date, max_date)
- returns the bill class with specified bill payments by various factors
- bill class contains:
    usr_id: user id
    min_date: start date of calculation
    max_date: end date of calculation
    power: power readings during the period
    dates: recorded dates and time during the period

    different prices:
        price_off_peak

-------------- spatial.py --------------


*** to do ***
-> need to change all the appliance information in the user_info database to be
    the name of corresponding appliance list name, and fix the access to the appliance to be db['listname']
-> create a database for all the existing appliance models


*** to do ***
def plot_spatial()
def generate_warning()
def how_you_should_use_your_electricity_wisely()
bill payment estimations subject to the seasons

-------------- Datetime format --------------
%b Month as locale’s abbreviated name(Jun)
%d Day of the month as a zero-padded decimal number(1)
